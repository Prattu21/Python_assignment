# Python Assignment
This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates foundational programming concepts, including **string manipulation, list operations (indexing, slicing, mutability), conditional logic, and type casting**.

---

##  Assignment Details


The code in this assignment covers the following key areas of Python programming:

### 1. Data Structure Indexing and Slicing
* **Strings:** Demonstrates various slicing techniques, including positive, negative, and step slicing (`name[start:end:step]`).
* **Lists:** Shows how to access and slice elements in single-dimensional lists.
* **Nested Data Structures:** Illustrates indexing into nested lists, tuples, and dictionaries (`l2[index1][index2]`).

### 2. List Mutability and Methods
* Demonstrates key list methods for adding and removing elements (`.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`).
* Shows how lists, unlike strings and tuples, can be modified in place.

### 3. Conditional Logic and Control Flow
* Implementation of an **`if/elif/else`** structure to calculate student grades based on marks (**Distinction, First Class, Second Class, Pass, Fail**).
* A practical example using a **`while` loop** and nested `if/else` for a fee calculation application.

### 4. Type Casting
* Examples of converting data types using built-in functions: `str()`, `float()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`, and identifying the `TypeError` when trying to cast a non-iterable type (like `int`) to an iterable type (like `list` or `dict`).
